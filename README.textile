h1. !http://railsapps.github.io/images/rails-36x36.jpg(Rails Application for Devise with RSpec and Cucumber)! Rails 3.2

This rails3-bootstrap-devise-cancan example application is outdated and has been replaced! For a Rails 4.1 example application for Devise with authorization, see "rails-devise-pundit":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-devise-pundit.

This Rails 3.2 example application shows how to use "Devise":https://github.com/plataformatec/devise with "CanCan":https://github.com/ryanb/cancan and "Twitter Bootstrap":http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/.

* "Devise":https://github.com/plataformatec/devise gives you ready-made authentication and user management.
* "CanCan":https://github.com/ryanb/cancan provides authorization for administrator access.
* "Twitter Bootstrap":http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ is a front-end framework for CSS styling.


h2. What Is Implemented -- and What Is Not

This is a demonstration application that allows you to visit a home page and see a list of users. Devise provides user management so a visitor can register with an email address and password and create an account. Devise provides authentication so access to the site can be limited to users who are registered and logged in. CanCan is used for authorization, limiting access to only an administrator for designated pages. An administrative dashboard allows the administrator to delete any user or change a user's role.

The @rake db:seed@ command sets up a database with an administrator who can view a administrative page when logged in. Additional users can be added; each is restricted from accessing the administrative page.

h2. Dependencies

Before generating your application, you will need:

* The Ruby language (version 1.9.3 or 2.0.0)
* The Rails gem (version 3.2.13)

See the article "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html for advice about updating Rails and your development environment.

h2. Getting the Application

You have several options for getting the code. You can _fork_, _clone_, or _generate_.

h3. Fork

If you'd like to add features (or bug fixes) to improve the example application, you can fork the GitHub repo and "make pull requests":http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/. Your code contributions are welcome!

h3. Clone

If you want to copy and customize the app with changes that are only useful for your own project, you can clone the GitHub repo. You'll need to search-and-replace the project name throughout the application. You probably should generate the app instead (see below). To clone:

<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/AlejandroFerroBejerano/rails_library.git
</pre>

You'll need "git":http://git-scm.com/ on your machine. See "Rails and Git":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-git.html.

h3. Generate

If you want to use the project as a starter app, use the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/ tool to generate a new version of the example app. You'll be able to give it your own project name when you generate the app. Generating the application gives you many additional options.

To build the example application, run the command:

<pre>
$ rails new rails_library
</pre>

This creates a new Rails app named @rails_library on your computer. You can use a different name if you wish.

h4. Template Engine

The example application uses the default "ERB" Rails template engine. Optionally, you can use another template engine, such as Haml or Slim. See instructions for "Haml and Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-haml.html.

h3. Edit the README

If you're storing the app in a GitHub repository, please edit the README files to add a description of the app and your contact info. If you don't change the README, people will think I am the author of your version of the application.

h2. Getting Started

See the article "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html to make sure your development environment is prepared properly.

h3. Use RVM

I recommend using "rvm":https://rvm.io/, the Ruby Version Manager, to create a project-specific gemset for the application. If you generate the application with the Rails Composer tool, you can create a project-specific gemset.

h3. Install the Required Gems

Check the Gemfile to see which gems are used by this application.

If you used the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/ tool to generate the example app, the application template script has already run the @bundle install@ command.

If not, you should run the @bundle install@ command to install the required gems on your computer:

<pre>
$ bundle install
</pre>

You can check which gems are installed on your computer with:

<pre>
$ gem list
</pre>

Keep in mind that you have installed these gems locally. When you deploy the app to another server, the same gems (and versions) must be available.

I recommend using "rvm":https://rvm.io/, the Ruby Version Manager, to create a project-specific gemset for the application. See the article "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html.

h3. Configure Email

This example application doesn't send email messages. However, if you want your application to send email messages (for example, if you plan to install the Devise @:confirmable@ module) you must configure the application for your email account. See the article "Send Email with Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-send-email.html.

h3. Configure Devise

You can modify the configuration file for Devise if you want to use something other than the defaults:

* *config/initializers/devise.rb*

h3. Configuration File

The application uses the "figaro gem":https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro to set environment variables. Credentials for your administrator account and email account are set in the *config/application.yml* file. The *.gitignore* file prevents the *config/application.yml* file from being saved in the git repository so your credentials are kept private. See the article "Rails Environment Variables":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-environment-variables.html for more information.

Modify the file *config/application.yml*:

<pre>
# Add account credentials and API keys here.
# See http://railsapps.github.io/rails-environment-variables.html
# This file should be listed in .gitignore to keep your settings secret!
# Each entry sets a local environment variable and overrides ENV variables in the Unix shell.
# For example, setting:
# GMAIL_USERNAME: Your_Gmail_Username
# makes 'Your_Gmail_Username' available as ENV["GMAIL_USERNAME"]
# Add application configuration variables here, as shown below.
#
GMAIL_USERNAME: Your_Username
GMAIL_PASSWORD: Your_Password
ADMIN_NAME: First User
ADMIN_EMAIL: admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD: administrator
ROLES: [admin, manager, reader]
</pre>

Set the user name and password needed for the application to send email.

If you wish, set your name, email address, and password for an administrator's account. If you prefer, you can use the default to sign in to the application and edit the account after deployment. It is always a good idea to change the administrator's password after the application is deployed.

Specify roles in the configuration file. You will need an "admin" role. Change the "user" and "VIP" roles as you wish.

All configuration values in the *config/application.yml* file are available anywhere in the application as environment variables. For example, @ENV["GMAIL_USERNAME"]@ will return the string "Your_Username".

If you prefer, you can delete the *config/application.yml* file and set each value as an environment variable in the Unix shell.

h3. Set the Database

Prepare the database and add the default user to the database by running the commands:

<pre>
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
</pre>

Use @rake db:reset@ if you want to empty and reseed the database.

Set the database for running tests:

<pre>
$ rake db:test:prepare
</pre>

If you’re not using "rvm":https://rvm.io/, the Ruby Version Manager, you should preface each rake command with @bundle exec@. You don’t need to use @bundle exec@ if you are using rvm version 1.11.0 or newer.

h2. Test the App

You can check that your application runs properly by entering the command:

@$ rails server@

To see your application in action, open a browser window and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000. You should see the default user listed on the home page. When you click on the user's name, you should be required to log in before seeing the user's detail page.

If you are using the default values from the *config/application.yml* file, you can sign in as the administrator using:

* email: admin@example.com
* password: administrator

You'll see a navigation link for Admin. Clicking the link will display a page with a list of users at
"http://localhost:3000/users":http://localhost:3000/users.

!http://i1286.photobucket.com/albums/a610/miguel92928/users_image_zps56mykf3g.png!

The second user will not see the Admin navigation link and will not be able to access the page at
"http://localhost:3000/users":http://localhost:3000/users.

Stop the server with Control-C.

If you test the app by starting the web server and then leave the server running while you install new gems, you’ll have to restart the server to see any changes. The same is true for changes to configuration files in the config folder. This can be confusing to new Rails developers because you can change files in the app folders without restarting the server. Stop the server each time after testing and you will avoid this issue.

h2. Customizing

This application provides no useful functionality apart from demonstrating Devise with CanCan and Twitter Bootstrap working together on Rails 3. Add any models, controllers, and views that you need.

For more complex applications that use Devise, CanCan, and Twitter Bootstrap, see:

* "rails-stripe-membership-saas":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-stripe-membership-saas example and tutorial
* "rails-prelaunch-signup":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-prelaunch-signup example and tutorial

h2. Testing

The example application contains a suite of RSpec unit tests and Cucumber scenarios and step definitions.

After installing the application, run @rake -T@ to check that rake tasks for RSpec and Cucumber are available.

Run @rake spec@ to run RSpec tests.

Run @rake cucumber@ (or more simply, @cucumber@) to run Cucumber scenarios.

Please send the author a message, create an issue, or submit a pull request if you can contribute improved RSpec or Cucumber files.

h2. Credits

Daniel Kehoe implemented the first version of the aplication (only user model with devise).
Alejandro Ferro Bejerano and Miguel Ángel Garrido Astilleros adapted this project to the specification of the practise subject "Web System Development"

h2. Web System Development specification

h3. Laboratory Assignment

The main goal of this exercise is to develop a web application with Ruby on Rails in which we are going to implement a web system for managing a library.
Through the exercise solving is advisable to use software development good practices, like version control software (like git or mercurial), code hosting (like github or bitbucket) or TDD (Test Driven Development, using RSpec).

The students must handle the solution to the laboratory professor and show him the system
working.

h3. Library Web App

We want to develop a Library Management Web Application in Ruby on Rails. This app should fulfil the following requirements:

- It should be accessible from any web browser
- Application should allow the user the management (CRUD operations) of:
    * Books and publications
    * Publications Borrowing and Circulation
    * Readers and Users
- The app should have a User Management module, which permits users to access the system by authenticating themselves and determining user roles:
    * Administrator: Can manage users (admins, managers and readers), roles, books and loans.
    * Manager: Can manage readers, books and loans.
    * Reader: Can list its current and past loans, and also can manage a wish list.
- Publications:
    * Can be borrowed by only one reader if they are physical books
    * Can be borrowed by several readers if they are in electronic form
    * We should keep a history of loans
You are asked to develop a web app to solve the proposed problem.
